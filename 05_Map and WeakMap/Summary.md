Both `Map` and `WeakMap` are data structures in JavaScript that allow you to store key-value pairs. However, they have several differences, mainly in terms of their behavior and use cases. Here are the key differences between `Map` and `WeakMap`:

1. **Key Types**:
   - **Map**: Keys can be of any type, including primitive types (like strings, numbers, and symbols) and objects.
   - **WeakMap**: Keys must be objects. Primitive data types (like strings or numbers) cannot be used as keys.

2. **Garbage Collection and Memory Management**:
   - **Map**: Keeps references to its keys, which means even if the key is no longer used elsewhere in the application, it won't be garbage collected.
   - **WeakMap**: Does not prevent its keys from being garbage collected. If the only reference to an object stored as a key in a `WeakMap` is from the `WeakMap` itself, that key-value pair can be garbage collected.

3. **Key Iteration**:
   - **Map**: Supports methods like `forEach`, `keys`, `values`, and `entries` for iterating over its keys, values, or key-value pairs.
   - **WeakMap**: Does not support methods like `keys`, `values`, and `entries`. It also doesn't have a `size` property or any way to determine its size.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - **Map**: Useful when you want to associate values with keys and ensure that those key-value pairs remain accessible for as long as they are stored in the `Map`.
   - **WeakMap**: Useful in scenarios where you want to associate additional data with objects without preventing those objects from being garbage collected. For instance, it can be used for caching information for objects without affecting the object's lifecycle.

5. **Properties and Methods**:
   - **Map**: Provides a variety of methods like `set`, `get`, `has`, `delete`, `clear`, and iterators like `forEach`, `keys`, `values`, and `entries`.
   - **WeakMap**: Provides methods like `set`, `get`, `has`, and `delete`. It does not have methods for iterating over its content.

6. **Comparison with `Object`**:
   - Both `Map` and `WeakMap` can be seen as alternatives to using plain objects (`Object` in JavaScript) for key-value storage.
   - Using `Object` for key-value storage has its own drawbacks, such as potential property name collisions and the inability to use objects as keys in a straightforward manner. `Map` and `WeakMap` provide more structured and predictable ways to manage key-value pairs.

In summary, while `Map` and `WeakMap` have similarities in storing key-value pairs, they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors, especially concerning garbage collection and key types. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your application.
