### Find the largest difference

One common question is to find the largest difference between any two numbers in an array. In this article, we will discuss a simple and efficient approach to solve this problem using JavaScript.

Given an array of numbers, our task is to write a function that finds the largest difference between any two numbers in the array. The difference is calculated as the absolute value of the subtraction of two numbers. For example, for the input array [-1, 2, 3, 10, 9], the largest difference would be 11, as the absolute difference between -1 and 10 is 11.

We can solve this problem efficiently in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array. The key idea is to iterate through the array while keeping track of the minimum value encountered so far and updating the largest difference as we traverse the array.


We can write a JavaScript function to solve this problem.

```js
function largestDiff(arr) {
  if (arr.length < 2) {
    return 0; // If the array is empty or has less than 2 elements, return 0.
  }

  let min = arr[0];
  let maxDiff = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, arr[i] - min); // Update maxDiff with the difference between current element and min value
    min = Math.min(min, arr[i]); // Update min if the current element is smaller
  }

  return maxDiff;
}

console.log(largestDiff([-1, 2, 3, 10, 9])); // Output: 11
console.log(largestDiff([])); // Output: 0
console.log(largestDiff([1])); // Output: 0
```

In this solution, we initialize the min variable with the first element in the array and initialize maxDiff to 0. Then, we iterate through the array and update maxDiff and min at each step. Finally, we return the maxDiff.
