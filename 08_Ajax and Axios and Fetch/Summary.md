Ajax, Axios, and Fetch are all technologies or libraries used for making asynchronous HTTP requests in web development. While they serve a similar purpose, there are some key differences among them.

1. **Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):**
   - **Type:** Ajax is a technique that uses a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML for making asynchronous requests.
   - **Browser Support:** It has been around for a long time and is supported by most modern browsers.
   - **Usage:** Ajax is not a library or a standalone tool; it's a set of techniques used to achieve asynchronous communication. It allows you to update parts of a web page without requiring a full page reload.

2. **Axios:**
   - **Type:** Axios is a JavaScript library for making HTTP requests from the browser or Node.js.
   - **Library:** Axios is a standalone library, and it is not built into the browser. You need to include it in your project.
   - **Promise-based:** Axios uses promises, which makes it easy to work with asynchronous code.
   - **Cross-browser:** Axios supports all major browsers and provides features like automatic transformation of JSON data.

3. **Fetch API:**
   - **Type:** The Fetch API is a modern, native JavaScript API for making HTTP requests.
   - **Native:** Unlike Ajax and Axios, Fetch is built into modern browsers, so you don't need to include any external libraries.
   - **Promise-based:** Like Axios, Fetch is also promise-based, making it easier to work with asynchronous code.
   - **Response handling:** Fetch uses the `Response` object, and you need to use methods like `json()` or `text()` to extract data from the response.

**Differences:**
- **Browser Support:** Ajax has been around for a long time and is supported by most browsers. Axios is a library that needs to be included separately. The Fetch API is native to modern browsers.
- **Promise-based:** Both Axios and Fetch are promise-based, making it easier to handle asynchronous operations compared to the traditional callback-based approach of Ajax.
- **Global Setup:** Ajax tends to use global settings for configurations, whereas Axios and Fetch allow for more fine-grained control and configuration of individual requests.
- **Cross-origin Requests:** Fetch follows the same-origin policy more strictly, whereas Axios automatically includes credentials in cross-origin requests if the request is made from a different origin with credentials.

In summary, while Ajax is a set of techniques using various web technologies, Axios and Fetch are more specialized tools for making HTTP requests in a cleaner and more modern way, with Fetch being the native option in modern browsers. The choice between Axios and Fetch often depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the developer or the project.
