这是关于程序员生活最真实的事情。你从这里开始。这是“愚蠢之山”。
This is the most real thing about the life of a programmer. You start here. This is the "Mountain of Stupidity".
Here is the truest thing about life as a programmer. You start off right here. This is mount stupid

事实是，如果你不相信自己是一个优秀的程序员，你永远无法攀登这座山。
The truth is that if you don't believe you are a good programmer, you will never be able to climb this mountain.
`The reality is` that if you don't believe that you are a good programmer, you're never going to scale this mountain.

你永远不会尝试解决可能超出你技能范围的问题。
You will never try to solve problems that may be beyond your skill range.
You're never going to `take on problems` that are probably `outside of your skill range`.

你永远不会尝试去做一些重大的事情，因为你总是在质疑自己，无法进入到“相当不错”的水平。
You will never try to do something significant because you are always questioning yourself and unable to reach a "pretty good" level.
You're never going to `attempt to do anything big`, because you're constantly `second guessing yourself` to be able to get into the mountain of being pretty good.

要变得相当不错，你必须经历“愚蠢之山”。没有捷径。
To become really good, you have to go through the 'Mountain of Stupidity'. There is no shortcut.
You have to go through mouth stupid. `There is no shortcut`.

你不能只是坐在那里，认为自己太愚蠢，什么也不做，然后期望能够绕过这座山。
You can't just sit there, think you're stupid, do nothing, and expect to get around the mountain.
You can't just sit there and think I'm too stupid and do anything and somehow just `walk around this mountain`.

你必须一次又一次地犯错，因为如果你不做出一系列真正糟糕的决定并从中学习，你就永远不会获得成为一名称职程序员的经验
You have to make mistakes over and over again, because if you don't make a series of really bad decisions and learn from them, you'll never gain the experience of becoming a competent programmer
You got to `make mistake after a mistake`, because if you don't make a series of really bad decisions and learn from them, you never `gain the experience` to become a `decent programmer`

如果你永远不成为一名称职的程序员，你就永远不会犯更大的错误，成为一名优秀的程序员
If you never become a competent programmer, you will never make bigger mistakes and become a great programmer.
And if you never become a decent programmer, you're never going to make bigger mistakes to become a great programmer.

学习只是一连串犯错并随后纠正它们的过程。
Learning is just a process of making mistakes and then correcting them.
`Learning is just a series of making bad decisions and correcting them Later on`.

没有任何书籍或东西可以阻止你通过犯错来学习。
There is no book or thing that can prevent you from learning through making mistakes.
There is no book. There is nothing that is going to `cure you from making mistakes to learn`.

所以，攀登“愚蠢之山”吧，因为在“愚蠢之山”后面，是成为一名高级工程师。
So, climb the "Stupid Mountain", because behind it is becoming a senior engineer.
So climb mount stupid because behind mount stupid is becoming a `senior engineer`.
