### Can variables globally declared with 'let' be accessed via the window object?

Variables declared with 'let' are not attached to the global 'window' object, and therefore cannot be accessed via 'window.variablename'. This is different from variables declared with 'var', which are mounted on the global object and can be accessed via 'window.variableName'.

For example, consider the following code:
```js
let foo = 'bar';
var baz = 'qux';
console.log(window.foo); // undefinedconsole.log(window.baz); // 'qux'
```

In this code, the variable 'foo' declared with 'let' is not accessible through 'window.foo', while the variable 'baz' declared with 'var' is accessible through 'window.baz'.


##### Are global 'let' variables accessible via the 'window' object?

No, they are not attached to the 'window' object.

##### How does 'var' differ from 'let' in global scope variable attachment?

'var' variables are attached to the 'window' object, 'let' variables are not.

##### What's an example showing how 'let' and 'var' behave differently in the global scope?
```js
let foo = 'bar'; console.log(window.foo); // undefined 
var baz = 'qux'; console.log(window.baz); // 'qux'.
```

##### Why is it important to understand the difference between 'let' and 'var' in the global scope?

It impacts how variables are accessed globally and helps avoid unexpected errors in JavaScript code.
