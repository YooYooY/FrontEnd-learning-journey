Let's start analyzing this problem.

First, we will receive a two-dimensional array and then extract the character information from it.

Here, I will understand this two-dimensional array as a coordinate plane with horizontal and vertical axes, with the origin at the top left corner.

According to the problem, we will extract characters diagonally. This means that the x-coordinate will continuously increase, the y-coordinate will increase to the highest point, then decrease, and then rebound again.

So here, I will declare a variable to determine whether y is increasing or decreasing.

Let's start writing the code.

The first step is to check the input parameters. Here, we assume that the input is always a two-dimensional array, so we will not do a type check.

Then we need to check for empty array situations:

```javascript
function decode(message) {
    if(message.length === 0) return '';
    if(message[0].length === 0) return '';
}
```

Next, we start by declaring variables for the coordinate axes `x` and `y`, as well as a variable `direction` to control whether it is increasing or decreasing:
```diff
function decode(message) {
    if(message.length === 0) return '';
    if(message[0].length === 0) return '';

+    let y = 0;
+    let x = 0;
+    let direction = 1;
}
```

We declare a variable `result` to store the result. Then, we can retrieve the characters from the two-dimensional array using the `x` and `y` variables:

```javascript
 let result = '';
 const char = message[y][x];
 result += char;
```

Because the condition here is increasing, and when we reach the last value of `x`, it will stop, so here I declare a `loop` function to execute recursively:
```diff
const loop = () => {
+ if(x >= message[0].length)  return;

 let result = '';
 const char = message[y][x];

 result += char;
+ x++;
+ y += direction;    

  loop();
}

loop();
```

Then, the most important condition is when `y` reaches the highest point, the `direction` variable needs to start decreasing, and when `y` reaches the bottom, the `direction` variable needs to start increasing:

```javascript
 // main determine
if(y >= message.length) {
    direction = -1;
    y = message.length - 2;
}

if(y < 0) {
     direction = 1;
     y = 1;
}
```

Here is the solution to this problem:
```js
function decode(message) {
    if(message.length === 0) return '';
    if(message[0].length === 0) return '';
    let y = 0;
    let x = 0;
    let direction = 1;
    let result = ''

    const loop = ()=>{
        if(x>=message[0].length)  return;

        const char = message[y][x]
        result+=char;
        x++;
        y+=direction;    

        // main determine
        if(y >= message.length) {
            direction = -1
            y = message.length - 2
        }

        if(y<0) {
             direction = 1
             y = 1
        }

        loop()   
    }
    
    loop()   

    return result
}
```
