In JavaScript, an array-like object is an object that has indexed elements and a `length` property but doesn't necessarily inherit from the `Array.prototype` or have all the methods that native arrays possess. Here are the key differences between an array-like object and a regular array:

1. **Prototype Chain**:
   - Regular arrays in JavaScript are instances of the `Array` constructor and inherit methods from `Array.prototype`.
   - Array-like objects do not inherit from `Array.prototype`. Instead, they are plain objects or instances of other constructors, such as `String` or `NodeList` (returned by methods like `document.querySelectorAll()`).

2. **Methods**:
   - Regular arrays have methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `slice()`, `forEach()`, etc., which are defined on `Array.prototype`.
   - Array-like objects, even if they have indexed properties and a `length` property, do not have these array methods by default. However, you can use array methods on them by borrowing them from `Array.prototype` or converting them into real arrays.

3. **Mutability**:
   - Regular arrays can be modified directly using methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `splice()`, etc.
   - While you can modify indexed properties of array-like objects, they do not have the built-in methods to modify them in the same way arrays do.

4. **Type Checking**:
   - Checking if an object is a regular array is straightforward with `Array.isArray()`. This method will return `true` for arrays and `false` for array-like objects.
   - Array-like objects can be identified by checking if they have indexed properties and a `length` property, but they are not instances of the `Array` constructor.

Example:

```javascript
// Regular array
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(Array.isArray(arr));  // true
console.log(arr instanceof Array);  // true

// Array-like object
const obj = {
  0: 'a',
  1: 'b',
  2: 'c',
  length: 3
};

console.log(Array.isArray(obj));  // false
console.log(obj instanceof Array);  // false

// Convert array-like object to array
const arrFromObj = Array.from(obj);
console.log(Array.isArray(arrFromObj));  // true
```

In modern JavaScript, when dealing with array-like objects, you often use methods like `Array.from()` or the spread syntax (`...`) to convert them into real arrays or utilize the array methods on them.
