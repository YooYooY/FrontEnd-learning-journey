In JavaScript, the `arguments` object is a special array-like object that contains all the arguments passed to a function. However, there are a few key differences between the `arguments` object and a regular array:

1. **Type and Methods**:
   - The `arguments` object is not an instance of `Array`. Even though it looks like an array and has a `length` property and indexed elements, it doesn't have the typical array methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `forEach()`, etc. 
   - To use array methods on `arguments`, you would have to convert it to a real array using methods like `Array.from(arguments)` or using spread syntax: `[...arguments]`.

2. **Modifiability**:
   - The `arguments` object behaves differently when it comes to modifying its contents. While you can directly modify elements in the `arguments` object like you would in an array, some operations that change the length of the array (like setting a new length using `length` property) might not work as expected. 

3. **Relationship with Named Parameters**:
   - The `arguments` object contains all the passed arguments, including any named parameters the function might have. This means that even if a function has named parameters, you can still access all passed arguments through the `arguments` object.

Here's a simple demonstration:

```javascript
function demoFunction(a, b, c) {
    console.log(arguments);            // Arguments object
    console.log(Array.isArray(arguments)); // false

    let argsArray = Array.from(arguments); // Convert arguments to array
    console.log(Array.isArray(argsArray));  // true

    console.log(argsArray.push(4));  // Works
    console.log(argsArray);         // [1, 2, 3, 4]
    
    // Modifying the arguments object directly:
    arguments[0] = 5;
    console.log(a);                 // 5 (value of 'a' has been modified)
}

demoFunction(1, 2, 3);
```

In modern JavaScript, with the introduction of arrow functions and rest parameters, the usage of `arguments` is less common. Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object, so if you want to collect all passed arguments, you would use the rest parameter syntax (`...args`).

In summary, while the `arguments` object provides a way to access all passed arguments within a function, it has some quirks and limitations compared to regular arrays.
