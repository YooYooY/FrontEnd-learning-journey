In JavaScript, an "array-like object" is an object that has properties and elements which resemble an array in the sense that it has a `length` property and can be accessed using numerical indices. However, these objects are not instances of the `Array` constructor and therefore don't inherit the array methods or properties that come with it. Here are the key differences between an array-like object and a regular array:

1. **Type and Methods**:
   - An array-like object is not an instance of the `Array` constructor. Thus, it doesn't have access to the array methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `forEach()`, etc. However, these methods can be applied to array-like objects after converting them to arrays using methods like `Array.from()` or the spread syntax `[...object]`.

2. **Prototype**:
   - Arrays in JavaScript inherit properties and methods from the `Array.prototype`. This means that regular arrays have access to methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `forEach()`, and others directly. In contrast, array-like objects do not have this prototype chain connection to `Array.prototype`.

3. **Modifiability**:
   - While both arrays and array-like objects can be modified (i.e., you can add, delete, or modify elements), the behavior may differ in certain situations, especially when using array methods. Array-like objects might not handle modifications in the same way arrays do because they lack the built-in methods that manage array state.

4. **Iterability**:
   - Both arrays and array-like objects can be iterated over using loops or built-in methods like `forEach()`. However, due to the absence of certain methods and properties, array-like objects may require additional steps or conversions for certain operations.

5. **Additional Properties**:
   - Array-like objects can have properties other than numeric indices (like string keys). While this is also possible with arrays in JavaScript (arrays are objects after all), it's more common to see non-numeric properties in array-like objects.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the differences:

```javascript
// Regular Array
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr instanceof Array);  // true
console.log(arr.push);              // [Function: push]

// Array-like Object
let obj = {0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3, length: 3};
console.log(obj instanceof Array); // false
console.log(obj.push);             // undefined

// Convert Array-like Object to Array
let arrFromObj = Array.from(obj);
console.log(arrFromObj instanceof Array); // true
console.log(arrFromObj.push);             // [Function: push]
```

In summary, while both arrays and array-like objects allow for the storage and retrieval of multiple values using numeric indices, arrays provide a richer set of built-in methods and properties specifically tailored for array operations. Array-like objects can be transformed into arrays to leverage these built-in methods.
