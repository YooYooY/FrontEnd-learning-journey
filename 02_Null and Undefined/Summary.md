In many programming languages, including JavaScript, "null" and "undefined" are two distinct concepts, although they can sometimes be used interchangeably in certain contexts. Here's a breakdown of the differences between them:

1. **Undefined**:
   - **Type**: `undefined` is a primitive type in JavaScript.
   - **Automatic Initialization**: Variables that are declared but not initialized automatically have a value of `undefined`.
   - **Absence of Value**: It represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
   - **Property Access**: If you try to access a property that doesn't exist on an object, you'll typically get `undefined`.
   - **Function Return**: Functions in JavaScript return `undefined` by default unless specified otherwise.
   - **Type Check**: You can use `typeof` to check for `undefined`.

     ```javascript
     let a;
     console.log(a);         // undefined
     console.log(typeof a);  // "undefined"
     ```

2. **Null**:
   - **Type**: `null` is also a primitive type in JavaScript.
   - **Explicit Assignment**: It represents the intentional absence of any value or object.
   - **Explicitly Set**: If you want to indicate that a variable or object property has no value, you can set it to `null`.
   - **Type Check**: `typeof null` returns `"object"`, which is a known historical bug in JavaScript. However, `null` is still considered a primitive type.

     ```javascript
     let b = null;
     console.log(b);         // null
     console.log(typeof b);  // "object" (Note: This is a quirk in JavaScript)
     ```

**In Summary**:
- `undefined` typically represents the absence of value due to lack of initialization or because a variable hasn't been assigned.
- `null` is used to explicitly indicate the absence of value or to reset a variable or object property.

While they are different, it's worth noting that they both represent "nothing" in a sense and can often be used interchangeably in casual usage. However, understanding their distinctions is crucial for writing clear and bug-free code.
