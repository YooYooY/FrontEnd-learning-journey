### The difference between 'for in' and 'for of'

Both `for...in` and `for...of` are loop statements in JavaScript, but they differ slightly in function and usage.

The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object, iterating through each property name (or key name) of the object as an iterative variable. Here is the basic syntax for `for...in`:
```js
for (variable in object) {
 // Write the loop body statement here
}
```

In this code, variable represents the name (or key name) of the current property in each iteration, while object refers to the object being traversed. For example:
```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
for (const key in obj) {
 console.log(key, obj[key]);
}
/*  Output of the result:
a 1
b 2
c 3
*/
```

It should be noted that the `for...in` loop iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, including both its own properties and inherited properties. Therefore, it is not suitable for iterating over arrays and array-like objects.

The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over the elements of an iterable object, treating each element of the object as an iteration variable. Here is the basic syntax for `for...of`:
```js
for (variable of iterable) {
 // Write the loop body statement here
}
```

In this code, variable represents the value of the current element in each iteration, and iterable refers to the iterable object to be traversed, such as arrays, strings, Sets, Maps, etc. For example:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (const item of arr) {
 console.log(item);
}
/* Output of the result:
1
2
3
*/
```

It should be noted that the `for...of` loop can only iterate over objects that implement the Iterator interface, therefore it is not suitable for regular objects. Additionally, it iterates over the element values of the object, rather than key names or property names.

To summarize, `for...in` is suitable for traversing an object's property names, whereas `for...of` is suitable for iterating over the element values of iterable objects, such as arrays and strings.


### Q&A

##### What is the primary use of the 'for...in' loop in JavaScript?
A: It's used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object.

##### What does the 'for...in' loop iterate through?
A: It iterates through each property name (or key name) of an object.

##### Does 'for...in' include inherited properties in iteration?
A: Yes, it iterates over both own properties and inherited properties.

##### Is 'for...in' suitable for iterating over arrays?
A: No, it's not recommended for arrays as it iterates over all enumerable properties.

##### What is the primary use of the 'for...of' loop in JavaScript?
A: It's used to iterate over the elements of an iterable object.

##### What types of objects can 'for...of' iterate over?
A: It can iterate over arrays, strings, Sets, Maps, and other iterable objects.

##### Can 'for...of' be used to iterate over regular objects?
A: No, it's not suitable for regular objects as it requires objects to implement the Iterator interface.

##### What is the main difference in what 'for...in' and 'for...of' iterate over?
A: 'for...in' iterates over property names, while 'for...of' iterates over element values.
