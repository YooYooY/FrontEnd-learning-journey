JavaScript has several built-in data types that can be categorized into two main categories: primitive data types and object data types. Let's discuss each type and their differences:

### 1. Primitive Data Types:

These are the basic or fundamental data types in JavaScript. They are immutable (i.e., their values cannot be changed).

- **Number**: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
  
  ```javascript
  let num = 10;   // Integer
  let floatNum = 10.5;  // Floating-point number
  ```

- **String**: Represents a sequence of characters.

  ```javascript
  let str = "Hello, World!";
  ```

- **Boolean**: Represents a logical entity and can have two values: `true` or `false`.

  ```javascript
  let isActive = true;
  let isLoggedOut = false;
  ```

- **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

  ```javascript
  let x;
  console.log(x);  // Outputs: undefined
  ```

- **Null**: Represents a deliberate absence of any value or object.

  ```javascript
  let y = null;
  ```

- **BigInt**: Represents whole numbers larger than `2^53 - 1` or smaller than `-2^53 + 1`.

  ```javascript
  let bigIntValue = BigInt(123456789012345678901234567890);
  ```

- **Symbol**: Introduced in ES6, represents a unique and immutable data type.

  ```javascript
  let sym = Symbol("description");
  ```

### 2. Object Data Types:

Objects in JavaScript are more complex and can hold multiple values (as properties) and methods.

- **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type.

  ```javascript
  let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
      console.log("Hello, " + this.name + "!");
    }
  };
  ```

- **Array**: A special kind of object that represents a list of elements. Arrays are ordered collections indexed by numbers.

  ```javascript
  let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
  console.log(fruits[0]);  // Outputs: apple
  ```

- **Function**: A special type of object that can be invoked.

  ```javascript
  function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

These data types have different characteristics, behaviors, and use cases in JavaScript. Understanding their distinctions is crucial for effective programming in JavaScript.
