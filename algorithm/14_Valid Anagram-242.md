## Solving the "Valid Anagram" Problem (LeetCode 242)

The "Valid Anagram" problem is a fundamental problem in string manipulation that tests your understanding of character frequency counting and string comparison.

### Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Solution Approaches

To solve this problem, we can consider multiple approaches:

1. **Sorting and Comparing**: Sort both strings and compare them.
2. **Using a Hash Map**: Count the frequency of each character in both strings and compare the counts.
3. **Using a Fixed-Size Array**: Since the problem constraints typically involve only lowercase English letters, we can use a fixed-size array for counting characters.

Let's explore each approach in detail.

### Solution 1: Sorting and Comparing

This approach involves sorting both strings and then comparing the sorted versions. If the sorted strings are identical, then one string is an anagram of the other.

#### Steps:
1. Sort both strings.
2. Compare the sorted strings.

#### Implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string} t
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    // If lengths are not the same, they cannot be anagrams
    if (s.length !== t.length) {
        return false;
    }
    // Sort both strings and compare
    return s.split('').sort().join('') === t.split('').sort().join('');
};

// Example usage
console.log(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram")); // true
console.log(isAnagram("rat", "car"));         // false
```

#### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the length of the strings.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the sorted versions of the strings.

### Solution 2: Using a Hash Map (or Object)

In this approach, we count the frequency of each character in both strings using a hash map (or JavaScript object), and then compare the frequency counts.

#### Steps:
1. Create a hash map to count the frequency of each character in `s`.
2. Subtract the frequency of each character in `t` from the hash map.
3. Check if all counts are zero.

#### Implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    let charCount = {};
    
    for (let char of s) {
        charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    for (let char of t) {
        if (!charCount[char]) {
            return false;
        }
        charCount[char]--;
    }
    
    return true;
};

// Example usage
console.log(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram")); // true
console.log(isAnagram("rat", "car"));         // false
```

#### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the strings.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because the hash map's size is limited by the number of possible characters (26 for lowercase English letters).

### Solution 3: Using a Fixed-Size Array

Since we know the input consists of lowercase English letters, we can use an array of fixed size 26 to count character frequencies.

#### Steps:
1. Create an array of size 26 initialized to 0.
2. Increment the count for each character in `s` and decrement for each character in `t`.
3. Check if all counts are zero.

#### Implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
var isAnagram = function(s, t) {
    if (s.length !== t.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    let charCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        charCount[s.charCodeAt(i) - 97]++;
        charCount[t.charCodeAt(i) - 97]--;
    }
    
    return charCount.every(count => count === 0);
};

// Example usage
console.log(isAnagram("anagram", "nagaram")); // true
console.log(isAnagram("rat", "car"));         // false
```

#### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the strings.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) due to the fixed-size array.

### Conclusion

The problem of determining if one string is an anagram of another can be solved efficiently using several different approaches. Sorting is a straightforward method but can be slower due to its O(n log n) complexity. Using a hash map or a fixed-size array for counting character frequencies provides an optimal O(n) solution. Choosing the right approach depends on your specific use case and constraints.
