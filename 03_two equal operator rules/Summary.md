In JavaScript, the `==` operator is known as the equality operator, and it performs type coercion when comparing values of different types. Type coercion is the process of converting a value from one type to another (for example, converting a string to a number) in order to perform an operation.

Here are the rules for the coercion of the `==` operator:

1. **Same Type and Value**: If both operands are of the same type (e.g., both are numbers, both are strings, etc.) and have the same value, then `==` returns `true`.

2. **Null and Undefined**: `null` and `undefined` are considered equal when using `==`. However, they are not equal to any other value.

   ```javascript
   null == undefined; // true
   null == 0;         // false
   ```

3. **Numbers and Strings**: When comparing a number and a string, JavaScript will attempt to convert the string to a number.

   ```javascript
   5 == "5";   // true
   5 == "5.0"; // true
   5 == "5.1"; // false
   ```

4. **Boolean and Non-Boolean**: When comparing a boolean with a non-boolean value, the boolean is converted to a number (true becomes 1, false becomes 0).

   ```javascript
   true == 1;  // true
   false == 0; // true
   true == "1"; // true
   ```

5. **Objects**: If both operands are objects, they are compared by reference, not by value. Two objects are considered equal only if they reference the same underlying object.

   ```javascript
   let obj1 = {};
   let obj2 = {};

   obj1 == obj1; // true (same reference)
   obj1 == obj2; // false (different references)
   ```

6. **NaN**: `NaN` is not equal to anything, including `NaN` itself.

   ```javascript
   NaN == NaN; // false
   ```

7. **Non-Primitive Types and Primitive Types**: When comparing a non-primitive type (object, array, function) with a primitive type (number, string, boolean), the non-primitive type is converted to a primitive type using the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation before the comparison is made.

It's important to be cautious when using the `==` operator because of its type coercion behavior, which can lead to unexpected results. In many cases, it's safer to use the `===` operator (strict equality) in JavaScript, which does not perform type coercion and checks both value and type.
